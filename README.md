# 🏋️‍♂️ Jayden Blom
**`Creative Web Developer`**

Hello! I am currently a student in Creative Media & Game Technologies at Hogeschool Rotterdam. I work on both personal projects and study-related assignments, all of which you can find here on my GitHub!
My projects are built from the ground up and often include the full development process: research, testing, prototyping, and deploying the final product. I’m also updating the README files of my older projects to better document this process where needed.
I’m always eager to learn new things. Whether it’s exploring new programming languages, improving my development skills, or experimenting with emerging technologies. While AI isn’t my main focus yet, I’m excited to explore how I might use it in future projects.

  <summary><h3>My Journey</h3></summary>
  
  I started my coding journey at the beginning of my studies. Before that, I had never actually written code myself. I was always interested, read about it, but never created anything. Starting out was surprisingly smooth: my study program encouraged us to quickly build our own projects. The core philosophy was simple: **learn by making**.
  For the first two years, I worked on school projects following structured guidelines and development processes. After that, I became more interested in learning independently. I started building small projects, including some on Roblox, where I published simple games. They weren’t huge projects, but they taught me the basics of working with game engines and the Lua programming language.
  In my third year, I completed a six-month internship focused mainly on the **front end of Laravel projects**. I worked with Bootstrap and Sass and learned a lot about front-end–specific practices, such as optimizing performance with lazy loading, and maintaining clear project structure and naming conventions.
  During the second half of that year, I developed my own project in Unity: a **Virtual Reality tool for creating stage plans**, called [StageIt](https://cmgt.hr.nl/projecten/stageit).  
  Working with Unity for six months helped me grow significantly in both C# and game development.
  In my fourth year, I followed the **Games minor**, where I worked mostly as a developer on two projects:  
  – [ShipBound](https://cmgt.hr.nl/projecten/shipbound)  
  – *Where We Went*  
  Currently, I’m focusing primarily on **web development**, working with the **MERN stack** as I continue building my skills and exploring new technologies.
