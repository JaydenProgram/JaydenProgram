# 🏋️‍♂️ Jayden Blom
**`Creative Web Developer`**

Hello! I am currently a student in Creative Media & Game Technologies at Hogeschool Rotterdam. I work on both personal projects and study-related assignments, all of which you can find here on my GitHub!
My projects are built from the ground up and often include the full development process: research, testing, prototyping, and deploying the final product. I’m also updating the README files of my older projects to better document this process where needed.
I’m always eager to learn new things. Whether it’s exploring new programming languages, improving my development skills, or experimenting with emerging technologies. While AI isn’t my main focus yet, I’m excited to explore how I might use it in future projects.

  <summary><h3>My Journey</h3></summary>
  I started my coding journey at the start of my study actually. Beforehand i never actually coded anything before, i was always interested and read into some stuff but never actually made something myself. Starting was really easy, my study made it so we could make our own project really quickly which was the main point. Learn by making. For 2 years i made projects in school following their guidelines and process. After these years i started becoming more interested myself in learning coding, i started making my own small projects on for example the platform Roblox. Where i published small games that were not really that special but did learn me the basics about game engines and the programming language LUA. In my third year i started out with half a year of an internship where i focused mainly on the frontend of Laravel projects. They used mainly bootstrap and Sass and i learned alot about specific front-end specific features. Like the importance of speed by using lazy loading, but also i learned alot about project structure and file and script naming conventions. For the second half year of my third year in this study i made my own project in Unity, which was a Virtual reality tool for creating your own stage plan
